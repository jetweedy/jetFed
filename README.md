A simple (and insecure) file editor for local projects. Good for local dev in virtual boxes.

Just download it, drop it in a php-capable folder somewhere on your local dev server, visit the editor.php page and go to town.
I'm mostly just stashing this here to save it somewhere, so I'm not documenting it very well yet.
